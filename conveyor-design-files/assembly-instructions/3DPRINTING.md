# 3D printing
The conveyor parts can be 3D printed using standard FDM printers. For the conveyor front and back pieces we have provided two versions. First is a two piece configuration that allows you to print these pieces on common printers that have a around a 200MM X 200MM build platforms (Note some printers may require you to expand the build platform in the slicing software to 202x202mm. If you do this please verify that this this is possible with your printer without damaging it. We will not be held responsible for damaged printers). Second is a single piece configuration that requires at least a 300MM X 300MM build platform.

While we have printed conveyor belts in both PLA and PET we recommend using PET as it has better thermal and long term durability properties. This is especially important for the front piece where the stepper motor is mounted and can generate a bit of heat. We have tested several print settings and it looks like ~30% in fill works fine however for parts that receive heat set inserts we have been printing them with 4 perimeters.
